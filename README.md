# Pytorch Tutorial
Welcome to my PyTorch tutorial repository, which contains a comprehensive guide to understanding and implementing PyTorch, one of the most popular machine learning libraries. These tutorial notebooks cover a range of topics, each with detailed explanations and code examples that will help you grasp the concepts easily.

In addition to the notebooks, I have also created brief, explanatory videos for each topic, which can be found on my YouTube channel. The six topics covered in this repository are:

1. Introduction(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6aGCtyVlfQ">Video</a>)
2. Autograd(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx7rwBQUZWQ">Video</a>)
3. Dataloader(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-D91Tj-rfdo">Video</a>)
4. Model(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APsmS9YqkqQ">Video</a>)
5. Basic training techniques(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAjj3YN2JFY">Video</a>)
6. Advanced training techniques(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-a-0lqyG0E">Video</a>)


Whether you are new to PyTorch or an experienced user, these tutorial notebooks and videos will provide you with the knowledge and skills to create your own Deep learning models using PyTorch.
